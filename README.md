# Weather App - EX1

## **Description :** Display fetched API data to the console.

```
There is a CORS issue with the API that is being used.
To circumvent this problem we used an external proxy service.

## **More**

```
The skycons.js file & style.css & weather.html files were provided to us. All we did was implement some vanilla javascript.
